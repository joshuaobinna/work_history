/**
  In this assessment, you will be creating new Javascript functions.
  Make sure to read the directions to build the functions carefully.
  You should use the below patterns to write your functions:
  ```
  function {{name_of_function}} {
    // Write your code here
  }

  OR

  const {{name_of_function}} = () => {
    // Write your code here
  }

  ```
*/

// 1. write a function that takes a number as a parameter and returns it as a
// string

// 2. write a function that takes a number as a parameter and returns that
// number subtracted by 1

// 3. write a function that takes a number as a parameter and returns that
// number added by 1

// 4. write a function that takes two number as its parameters and returns then
// addition of those two numbers

// 5. write a function that takes two number as its parameters and returns then
// squared of those two numbers

// 6. write a function that takes a number and returns true if the number is odd
// and false if it is not

// 7. write a function that takes two strings as its parameters and returns the
// combination of those two strings

// 8. write a function that takes the radius of a circle a parameter and returns
// the Area of the circle.
// For this exercise Ï€ (pie) can equal `3.14`
